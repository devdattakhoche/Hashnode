## Depth-First Search - Graph Traversal Algorithm

## Hey Everyoneüëãüëã

Graphs are really an important part of our though we may not be aware of them.
There are *n* number applications of Graph as we can visualise any data in a graph format.

Eg :
1. LinkedIn Connections (Social Graph)
2. Navigation Systems
3. Recommendation Systems and much more...

In this blog, we will see how depth-first search works. Now the depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm meaning it is an algorithm to go through the graph and do processing as and when required.

Now without any further statements, let's dive in...

## üåüLet's get Started

Let us first understand what a graph is and what does looks like?

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of Vertices and Edges.
Woosh! This is a very formal definition ü•µ.

In simple terms, a graph is a set of some variables which we call vertices here and some relationships which call as edges.
Here is what it looks like :

Here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are nodes and connections between them are called edges.
Enough of the Graph explanation, let us look at DFS now. ü§ö

### üìâ Depth First Search - DFS
As I mentioned earlier DFS is a graph traversal algorithm meaning that it helps us go through graphs. There is also another graph traversal algorithm known as Breadth-First Search (BFS). The goal of both algorithms is the same but the methods to do that are different.

Let us take a look at the working of DFS :
```
Step 1: Start with any node 'N'
Step 2: Mark 'N' as Visited
Step 3: Explore all the Nodes connected to 'N'
Step 4: While Exploring any node mark the specific node as Visited 
Step 5: If a node is visited already do not explore it again
Step 6: Stop when all the nodes are visited

```
Sounds easy, does it ? 

It might not but it is way too easy, you'll have a clear understanding of it once we go through an example.

```
Let us take the Graph mentioned above :   
        
     2  ---- 4  
  /  |          
1    |          
  \  |          
     3  ---- 5  

1. We can start with any node, let us say we start with 2
2. After visiting 2, first explore all nodes which are connected to node 2
3. As node 1 is not explored go to node 1 (you can also go to node 3 or 5)
4. Now first explore all nodes connected to node 1
5. As node 3 is not explored goto node 3
6. Now explore all nodes connected to node 3
7. Here we can choose 2 or 5, but as 2 is already visited we will choose 5
8. As node 5 is a leaf node, we now go back to exploring node 1 
9. Here we visited nodes 2 and 3 already, so we go back to node 2
10. Atlast at node 2 we are left with node 4 as nodes 1 & 3 are explored

So in this way, we have visited and explored the whole graph --> 2,1,3,5,4

```

The reason we mark nodes as "visited" is that , in the graph there are cycles due to which we might end up in an endless loop of visiting them, so once we visit a node, in order to avoid revisiting it again we mark it as visited.


### ‚åõTime Complexity Analysis


![TickTockJasonMantzoukasGIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643375347151/qeUHK5gR64.gif)

If we say that the graph has ***'v'*** number of nodes and ***'e'*** number of Edges.
Then the time complexity of DFS is in Order of \\(v+e\\)  that is it can be represented in the form :

$$
O( v + e )
$$

The space complexity of the algorithm is \\(O(v)\\).

### üë®‚ÄçüíªCode

In this code below, the `adjlist` is an adjacency list.
Now an adjacency list is a representation of a graph in which each node has a list of nodes that are adjacent to it that is the nodes that are connected to it.

Here is a recursive approach that builds a stack due to recursion.
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<int,bool> visited;
unordered_map<int,vector<int>> adjlist;

void dfs(int node){
  visited[node] = true; // Mark the node visited
  cout << node << " ";  // Print the node
   // loop through adjacent nodes
  for (int i=0 ; i < adjlist[node].size() ; i++) { 
    if( visited[ adjlist[node][i] ] == false ) 
          dfs(adjlist[node][i]);  // explore the node if not visited
  }
}

int main(){ 
  vector<pair<int,int>> relationships = {
      {1,2},
      {1,3},
      {2,3},
      {2,4},
      {3,5}
  };
     // build Adjacency list
    for(auto x : relationships){
        adjlist[x.first].push_back(x.second);
        adjlist[x.second].push_back(x.first);
    }

    dfs(2);
   return 0;
}

```
```
Output : 
2 1 3 5 4 
```

Here is another approach explicitly using stack.
This is indeed a good application of stack .

Psuedo Code for stack approach :
```
1. Select a start node
2. Push the node to stack
3. do steps 4 and 5 until the stack is not empty
4. Pop a value from stack say 'N'
5. If node 'N' is not visited do steps 6 and 7 else goto step 4 again
6. Mark 'N' as Visited
7. do step 8 for all adjacent nodes to 'N'
8. Push adjacent node 'x' if x is not visited.
9. End when stack is empty
```

Code with Stack in action 

```

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<int,bool> visited;
unordered_map<int,vector<int>> adjlist;

void dfs(int node){
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(node); // push source node
    while(!s.empty()){ // loop until stack is empty
        int n = s.top(); // get top element
        s.pop(); // pop from stack 
        if(visited[n]==false){
            visited[n] = true; // mark visited;
            cout<<n<<" ";
            // loop through adjacent nodes
            for (int i=0 ; i < adjlist[n].size() ; i++) {
                if( visited[ adjlist[n][i] ] == false ) 
                    s.push(adjlist[n][i]); // push to stack if not visited
            }
        }   
    }
}


int main(){
  
  vector<pair<int,int>> relationships = {
      {1,2},
      {1,3},
      {2,3},
      {2,4},
      {3,5}
  };

    for(auto x : relationships){
        adjlist[x.first].push_back(x.second);
        adjlist[x.second].push_back(x.first);
    }

    dfs(2);
   return 0;
}

```
```
Output :
2 4 3 5 1 
```

Note that you can start with any node in DFS.

## üéØFinal Thoughts

Amazing! Congrats on making it to the end of the article!

DFS is a great way to enter into the graphs world. Do try to implement the code on your own, you will get a much better understanding by doing that.

[Here](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1627/C) is a good question if you want to get a hang of it.
