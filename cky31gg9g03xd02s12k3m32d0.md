## Getting Started with Ethereum Blockchain and Solidity

## Hey Everyone üëãüëã
By now you have probably heard of Blockchain and Web 3.0 and it is already the best time get started with it. 

Now, according to Wikipediaüåê: 

> Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Œû) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

In simple terms to me it is a developer's blockchain which is running on multiple computers where we can   deploy and develop our own smart contracts to build decentralized applications (Dapps).

**üìÉ What are smart contracts ?**

Smart contracts are just like physical paper contracts except they don't need paper üòÖ or any manual work to execute them. All the instructions are automated and these instructions get executed when certain conditions are met.

To write smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain we need Solidity.
Solidity is programming language which is needed to write smart contracts.

Okay, that's a lot to take in, lets dive into coding our own simple bank in solidity.üòÅ


## ü§öBefore we begin

Let us define our bank functionalities first: 

1.  Adding money to the bank
2. Withdraw money from the bank
3. View current balance for user
4. View total funds

## üßë‚ÄçüíªLets get started ..

**Step 1Ô∏è‚É£** :  We will be needing a IDE for writing our smart contracts with solidity. For 
                that we will be using Remix. It is browser base compiler and code editor which will help us write and deploy our smart contracts on Ethereum Virtual Machine.

As it is browser based it saves a lot of setup time. You can click on the link below to go the IDE.

%[https://remix.ethereum.org]

**Step 2Ô∏è‚É£** : Now once you have opened the IDE, create a new file with extension `.sol`.
All the solidity files are stored with the extension  `.sol` . This file contain all of the code required.

**Step 3Ô∏è‚É£** : Once you have done this , you are ready to write some code.
Before we implement actual function , let us first understand the layout of the solidity source file.

Every file should start with a comment which basically indicates license of that particular file. 

` // SPDX-License-Identifier : <License>`

Comments in solidity are similar to that of `C`and `C++` :

```
// This is a single-line comment. Somehow markdown doesn't understand it. 
/*
This is a
multi-line comment.
*/
```

`Pragma`
The second line should be Pragma in solidity. Now pragma is a directive that specifies the compiler version to be used for current Solidity file.

`pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;`

You can read more about the layout  [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.0/layout-of-source-files.html) .

**Step 4Ô∏è‚É£** : Lets create our first smart contract now.
To create a contract you need use the key word `contract` before the name of the contract.

```
contract MyFirstSmartContract{
           // Every thing related to this contract goes here
}

```
So far our file looks like this : 
```
 // SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract MyFirstSmartContract{
           // Every thing related to this contract goes here
}

```

Voil√† Congratulations on creating your first smart contract.

**Step 5Ô∏è‚É£** : Once we have done this, we are ready to implement core bank functions.

**Retrieve total Funds**
```
uint256 totalFunds = 0;
function getTotalFunds() public view returns(uint){
        return totalFunds;
    }

```
Here `uint256` is  unsigned integer of 256 bits. Basically it is a datatype.
`View` keyword here signifies that this is a static function which does not modify the state. Similarly `public` keyword here is a visibility specifier.

**Adding Funds to the Bank**

```
mapping(address => uint) funds;
    
function addFunds() public payable {
        funds[msg.sender] = funds[msg.sender] +  msg.value;
        totalFunds = totalFunds + msg.value;
    }

```

`mapping(address => uint) `  this is a mapping, it is just like dictionary or hashmap which is used to store data in key value pairs, key here is the `address` from which we are receiving funds and value is the value of funds sent by the user.

As `addFunds` function will receive funds, we make this function `payable`.
Now a payable function provides the mechanism of receiving or collecting ethers.
These functions are annotated with the payable keyword. 

`msg.sender` here is the address of the wallet which added the Funds and `msg.value` is the amount which he wants to  add in the contract. We are mapping the address to the amount, so we can keep track of the deposited funds.

**Retrieve account balance**
```
function getUserBalance(address userAddress) public view returns(uint) {
        uint value = funds[userAddress];
        return value;
    }

```
This function returns the balance which is deposited by a particular address.

**Withdrawing Balance**

```
function withdrawFunds() public payable {
        address payable withdrawTo = payable(msg.sender);
        uint amountToTransfer = getUserBalance(msg.sender);
        withdrawTo.transfer(amountToTransfer);
        totalFunds = totalFunds - amountToTransfer;
        funds[msg.sender] = 0;
    }

```

To transfer money from our smart contract to some other address we use the transfer method. This method reverts automatically if any error occurs.

To sum up all the code  : 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT

pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract SimpleBank{

uint256 totalFunds = 0;
function getTotalFunds() public view returns(uint){
        return totalFunds;
    }

mapping(address => uint) funds;

function addFunds() public payable {
        funds[msg.sender] = funds[msg.sender] +  msg.value;
        totalFunds = totalFunds + msg.value;
    }

function getUserBalance(address userAddress) public view returns(uint) {
        uint value = funds[userAddress];
        return value;
    }

function withdrawFunds() public payable {
        address payable withdrawTo = payable(msg.sender);
        uint amountToTransfer = getUserBalance(msg.sender);
        withdrawTo.transfer(amountToTransfer);
        totalFunds = totalFunds - amountToTransfer;
        funds[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

```

**Step 6Ô∏è‚É£** :  Now that you have created you bank, lets compile and deploy it on JavaScript VM.

To Compile the file goto Solidity Compiler  and hit the compile button : 


![Screenshot 2022-01-06 180033.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641472318286/BQ6y6KZw6.png)

Once that is done , you can deploy your contract in deploy tab below it.
After you have deployed it successfully you can see the following buttons under the deployed contract.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641472474823/4g3PPAmK0.png)

Here the red buttons signify that these functions modify the state of the contract and the blue buttons signify that these are static functions and don't modify the state of the contract.

To add Funds, you first need to input the amount  : 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641472635493/I30HJMHn8.png)

After this you can hit the addFunds button, it will do the transaction and the funds will be added to the smart contract. To get the specific user balance, you need the address of the account which you can see here at the top.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641472803912/z1RNHQ9Rb.png)

You can paste this address in the `getUserBalance ` input feild and retrieve the amount mapped to that address.

Feel free to play with the functionalities of code and Remix IDE.

**Step 7Ô∏è‚É£ **: Now as you have made your own smart contract let us deploy it on Rinkeby Test Network.
For this you will be needing an actual wallet (address), which you can create on Metamask ü¶ä.
Its really simple to do that, you can create your own Metamaskü¶ä account [here].(https://metamask.io/download.html) .

![Screenshot 2022-01-06 181812.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641473539739/uwyDOgE1i.png)

Once you have done that, you need to get some test ethers to start with, you get it  from [here ](https://fauceth.komputing.org/) for rinkeby network. 

Now to deploy your contract to the test net go to the Remix IDE and instead of JavaScript VM, select Injected Web3.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641474029951/mR53FQw2a.png)

Metamask will Popup and ask for permission. Now you can add balance and every transaction will be added to the blockchain, which is hosted on the same testnet.
You can look it up  [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)  by pasting  the address of your metamask account. The transactions will look like this.

Congrats on Successfully deploying your first Smart Contract on Test net. ü•≥üéâ
