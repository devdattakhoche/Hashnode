## Bit Manipulation  Basics ,Tip and Tricks

## Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

As a programmer we often work with multiple data types such as int, float etc, (Pythonista's be like: ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‚" ) but sometimes we need to deal with bits and bytes as 
 computers do not understand words and numbers the way we do. 

Bits and bytes can be scary at some times while solving a problem or doing competitive programming. If the basics of the same are not clear they can be a nightmare. Dealing with such questions need some basics and some tips which we will discuss in this article.

Without further explanation, let us begin.

## âœ…Basics of Bit Manipulation

Every number can be represented in a binary form, this binary form has consists of 1 and 0s which we call as and bits. Manipulating these bits to get the desired output is known as bit manipulation.

There are 6-bit operators which we should know, these are operators are really important and help crack most of the questions. Always remember to think in bits when you approach a problem related to bit manipulation.

* `AND` - `&`- If both inputs are true, then the output is true.
* `OR` - `|`- If either of the inputs is true, then the output is true.
* `XOR` - `^` - EXCLUSIVE OR - If either, but not both, of the inputs, is true, then the output is true.
* `NOT` - `~` -  Negation operator takes each bit in a number and toggles it
* `Left Shift` - `<<` -  The most-significant bit is lost, and a 0 bit is inserted on the other end.

Eg : 
```
0110 << 1  =  1100
0110 << 3  =  11000
```
* `Right Shift` - `>>` -  The least-significant bit is lost and a 0 is inserted on the other end.

Eg : 

```
1111 >> 1  =  0111
1111 >> 3  =  0001
```

Here is a truth table to understand the rest of the operators :

## ðŸ”° Tips and Tricks



![å–”å–”GIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1644506281682/fmQM05nQr.gif)

#### ðŸŒŸDivide and Multiply by 2
To divide by 2 we right shift the number by 1 and to multiply by 2 we left shift the number 1.

```
int divideby2(int n){
        return n >> 1;
    }

int multiplyby2(int n){
        return n << 1;
    }

```
#### ðŸŒŸCheck if a given number is even
If a number is even then  `and` of that number with `1 ` will yield 0.
```
bool isEven(int n){
        return (n & 1) == 0;
    }
```
#### ðŸŒŸCheck if a given number is a power of 2 

To do this we use `and` operator, if a number `n` is the power of 2 then doing  `and` operation of `n` with `n-1` will give `0`.

```
 bool isPowerof2(int n){
        if(n==0)
            return false;
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }

```


#### ðŸŒŸSwap two numbers without a temporary variable
We can swap two numbers with xor operation.
```
void swap(int& a, int& b){
        a = a ^ b;
        b = b ^ a; 
        a = a ^ b;
        cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
    }
```

#### ðŸŒŸGet `ith` bit
To get the `ith` we right shift by `i` bits.
Note: The indexing of `i` in this article starts from `0`.
```
int getbit(int n, int i){
        return (n >> i);
    }
```
#### ðŸŒŸSet `ith` bit
To set the `ith` bit you can use a bitmask with the `ith` bit set, meaning you create another binary number with `ith` bit set and do `or` operation,
```
int setbit(int n, int i){
        return n | (1 << i);
}

```
#### ðŸŒŸUnset `ith` bit
To unset `ith` bit create a bitmask with ith unset bit and rest all set bits, we can do this by negation operator and left shift operator and do `and` operation which will unset the `ith` bit.
```
int unsetbit(int n, int i){
        return n & ~(1 << i);
    }
```
#### ðŸŒŸToggle `ith` bit
To toggle `ith` bit we create a bitmask with the `ith` bit set and do the `xor` operation.
```
int togglebit(int n, int i){
        return n ^ (1 << i);
    }
```
#### ðŸŒŸCount number of set bits
To count set bits we do `and` operation with `1` to check if the last bit is set and left shift `n` until it becomes zero.
```
int countsetbits(int n){
        int count = 0;
        while(n){
            count+=n&1;
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
####  ðŸŒŸMost significant set bit and least significant set bit

For LSB we right shift and do `and` operation with 1.
If it is set we `return` the position. 
```
int lowestsetbit(int n){
        int i = 0;
        while(n){
            if(n & 1)
                return i;
            n = n >> 1;
            i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
```

For MSB we right shift until `n` is not zero.

```
int highestsetbit(int n){
        int i = 0;
        while(n){
            n = n >> 1;
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }

```
#### ðŸŒŸHighest power of 2 less than or equal to the given number
We first get the most significant bit position and left-shift 1 by `i`.

```
int highestPowerof2(int n){
        int i = 0;
        while(n){
            n = n >> 1;
            i++;
        }
        return (1 << i);
    }
```
#### ðŸŒŸ Count number of set bits on `ith` position from a list of numbers

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


vector<int> getsetbits(vector<int> arr){

    vector<int> count(32,0);

    for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < 32; j++)
                count[j] += (1&(arr[i] >> j));
    return count;

}

int main(){
    vector<int> arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
    vector<int> count = getsetbits(arr);

    for(int i = 0; i < count.size(); i++)
        cout<<count[i]<<" ";

    return 0;
}
```
